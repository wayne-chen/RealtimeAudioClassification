# Wendy Ju

Teacher at Cornell Tech
teaching here (CCRMA) during PhD for a year in 2001

# David Goedicke

was at Stanford for 1/2 a year before moving over to Cornell Tech
Neural nets are easy to do on the computer

# Today's Schedule

Introductions 9:00AM
Neural Nets 10AM-noon (Lecture)
Lunch noon-1:30PM
Lab Setup 1:30-3:30PM
Cats & Dogs Lab 3:30-5PM (Binary classification)

Wendy learned electrons are flowing to ICs with Matt Wright, research director at CCRMA

teach class, making extensive use of libraries

# Lecture

neural net is a network of connected "neurons" that perform "simple" input on a number input

try input values and expected outputs to get alphas to fit the estimated output 

gradient function find the local minimum with the lowest loss

deep convolutional network

(Tensorflow For Poets)
Look at frequency bands in spectrogram to identify salience and classify accordingly for images

spectrogram generation for dogs vs cats sounds (howls/barks/meows/hisses/etc.)

neural nets for CV vs audio are a horrible crossover because of resolution and the dimensionality - Wnedy

Urban Sounds Datasets and other datasets are going to be used throughout the course of the workshop

tomorrow will be recording outdoor sounds

# after lunch

use high sampling rate and retain high resolution so that timbre and pitch is retained for distinguishing the difference for binary classification
