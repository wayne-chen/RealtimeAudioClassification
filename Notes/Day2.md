# Recap
we created generated data with images with spectrograms
running num epochs and checking loss calculation at each epoch

Mel freqeuncy spectrum
400-800Hz seems like a doubling
800-1200Hz is like quadrupling

the spectrum is logarithmic
tries to match how people perceive audio

build images based on the resolution of the spectrogram and don't want banding either

# checking out the urbansounds dataset
1302 labeled creative commons sound recordings from freesound.org from NYC
each recording labeled with start/end times of sound events from 10 classes

making a stanford sounds dataset
